\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we focus on CFG based memory leaks detection with complex control flows. We propose a novel projection-based approach to increase the efficiency in detecting memory leaks. We develop a prototype system named PML\_Checker and evaluate our approach by comparing with other approaches on public benchmarks (SARD and SPEC CPU $2000$). Experimental results show that our approach has better effectiveness than other approaches in detecting memory leaks on programs with complex control flows and complex data types. In addition, our approach can accurately find memory leaks, i.e., finding more leaks with much fewer false negatives than previous detection tools. As future work, we plan to improve our approach in scalability, specifically, by combining other methods such as data flow analysis to improve the detection accuracy.
