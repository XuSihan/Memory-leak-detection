\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we focus on memory leak detection with complex control flows. We propose a novel projection-based approach to increase the accuracy in detecting memory leaks in C source code. We implement a detection tool named PML\_Checker and evaluate our approach by comparing with three open-source tools on public benchmarks (SARD, SPEC CPU $2000$ and SIR) and study cases. Experimental results show that our approach has better effectiveness than three other approaches in detecting memory leaks in C source code with complex control flows and complex data types. Apart from this, our approach can precisely find memory leaks, i.e., finding more leaks with much fewer false negatives than previous detection tools. In the future work, we plan to improve our approach in scalability. Specifically, we will improve the detection accuracy by combining with other static methods such as data flow analysis.
