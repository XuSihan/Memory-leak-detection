\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we focus on memory leak detection with complex control flows. We propose a novel projection-based approach to increase the efficiency in detecting memory leaks. We develop a detection tool named PML\_Checker and evaluate our approach by comparing with three open-source tools on public benchmarks (SARD, SPEC CPU $2000$ and SIR). Experimental results show that our approach has better effectiveness than three other approaches in detecting memory leaks in C source code with complex control flows and complex data types. Apart from this, our approach can accurately find memory leaks, i.e., finding more leaks with much fewer false negatives than previous detection tools. As future work, we plan to improve our approach in scalability, specifically, by combining other methods such as data flow analysis to improve the detection accuracy.
